# Raytracer

* It's parallelized to allow for fast performance.
* It has a flexible material system, allowing for quickly creating custom types
* It's written in Rust, so it's fast and safe


This was my first project after reading the Rust Book. I'm happy with the result. 

It's a WIP. I'm working on cleaning up some of the code and moving it out of the main file.
